### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - Facebook May Be Ordered to Change Data Practices in Europe

-  Reference or article citation.
 - [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/technology/facebook-european-union-data-privacy.html)

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Facebook is currently facing a problem regarding the ability to move data
   from its European users to the United States for further analysis. This
   problem was brought to notice because European officials raised concerns that
   the data being transferred is not being handled correctly and causing harm
   to European citizens.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - In my opinion the ethical concern that is mentioned in the article is that
   the Data gathered from European users of the Facebook app are being
   transferred to the United States for further analysis. This raises an ethical
   concern because this does not adhere to the regulations that were
   established.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is being manipulated in the article is user generated data that
   is created when users use the Facebook app.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - While using the Facebook app, data is generated in the background such as
   your current location or even your interest based on what actions you have
   taken while using the app.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - In this form of analysis the users of the Facebook app potentially lose
   because their actions are being traced very specifically which is considered
   a data breach if the regulations do not allow for this type of analysis.
   However, the administrators at Facebook will gain from this because they are
   able to analyze this data in order to further benefit from this data.

### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - Portland passes broadest facial recognition ban in the US

-  Reference or article citation.
 - [CNN BUSINESS](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/09/tech/portland-facial-recognition-ban/index.html)

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The main point of this article is to express the concern that facial
   recognition technology is being used around the whole world but some cities
   in the United States are banning this feature because of privacy breaches
   this causes.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern that the use of surveillance technology causes is the
   lack of privacy that citizens have. This is a concern because government
   officials are able to track your location constantly due to the use of facial
   recognition.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is being manipulated in this article is data regarding facial
   features of individuals in the city of Portland. This manipulation allows
   officials to track everyones location through security cameras.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The analysis from my understanding is that city officials in Portland are
   using data generated from security cameras to identify individuals and track
   their locations from the system of cameras that are established through out
   the city.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The citizens in Portland are losing in this situation because they are
   constantly being tracked which decreases their privacy. The government and
   city officials are gaining from this situation because they are able to track
   individuals location as well as track potential criminals or even suspicious
   activities such as protests or riots.
